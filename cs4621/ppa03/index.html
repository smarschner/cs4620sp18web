    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>
        In this programming assignment, you will implement a simple maze crawler.
        The user will traverse through a virtual maze that is built dynamically from textual input. The maze will be
        displayed from a first-person perspective. When the user presses the arrow keys, this triggers an animation
        which moves the user to discrete positions within the maze.
    </p>

        has changed in places, but everything in this video is up to date.
    </small>

    <h2>Logistics</h2>

    <p>
        First, download the <a href="ppa03_framework.zip">framework code</a>. We recommend creating a git repository for
        development, but <b>please don't share your code publicly.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Inside the directory, open <code>index.html</code>, and you should see a web page with a black canvas 
        and some controls.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please modify <code>index.html</code> so that it implements a maze crawler with behavior that is similar
        to the one in the video. You may also add other code to the directory. However, do not use any 3D rendering
        frameworks such as <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a>. Linear algebra libraries such as
        <a href="http://glmatrix.net/">glMatrix</a> and convenience libraries such as 
        <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> and <a href="http://www.createjs.com/preloadjs">PreloadJS</a>
        are fine.  In fact, we have included these in the distributed framework code.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once you're done writing your solution, ZIP the directory, and submit
        the ZIP file to CMS.
    </p>


    <h2>Maze Specification</h2>

    <p>
        A maze is a <i>rectangular</i> grid divided into equally sized cells.  A cell is a square in
        the $xy$-plane whose size is $1 \times 1$ (in some unit of distance).  There are two types of cells: <b>walkable</b>
        and <b>unwalkable</b>.  If a walkable cell is adjacent to an unwalkable cell, there must be a vertical
        wall on their common cell edge.  A vertical wall is also a square with a size of $1 \times 1$.
        One of its dimension is the $z$-axis, which is our vertical axis.</p>
    <p>
        A maze is specified by its text representation that is entered into the "Maze" text area in
        <code>index.html</code>.  The text representation may contain the following types of characters:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>A newline character; i.e. <code>\n</code>.</li>
        <li>The pound character <code>#</code>, representing an unwalkable cell.</li>
        <li>The dot character <code>.</code>, representing a walkable cell.</li>
        <li>
            A directional character, <code>N</code>, <code>E</code>, <code>W</code>, or <code>S</code>,
            representing a walkable cell in which the camera starts.  These four characters represent
            the initial "heading" of the camera.  The heading is the 2D direction in the $xy$-plane of the
            view direction.  It is specified as the angle the view vector makes with the
            positive $x$-axis.
            <ul>
                <li><code>N</code> is the "north" direction $(0,1,0)$ and the heading is $\pi/2$.</li>
                <li><code>E</code> is the "east" direction $(1,0,0)$ and the heading is $0$.</li>
                <li><code>W</code> is the "west" direction $(-1,0,0)$ and the heading is $\pi$.</li>
                <li><code>S</code> is the "south" direction $(0,-1,0)$ and the heading is $3\pi/2$.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        A valid string representation must satisfy the following conditions:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            The characters must form a rectangle.  In other words, every line of the string must have
            the same number of characters.
        </li>
        <li>
            Every character of the border of the rectangle must be <code>#</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
            There is exactly one directional character in the string.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>The template code has a function that checks the above conditions.  If one of them is not satisfied,
    the code will throw an exception, and the program will stop.  As a result, you don't have to worry
    about these cases when you program, but you should keep them in mind when editing the string representation
    to test your program.</p>

    <p>
        The string representation shows what the maze looks like when viewed from above (i.e.
        from where the $z$-coordinate is high).  If the string representation has $h$ rows and
        $w$ (non-whitespace) characters in each row, then there are $w \times h$ cells in the maze,
        and the maze should occupy the rectangle $[0,w] \times [0,h]$ in the $xy$-plane.
        The character at the bottom left corner of the string representation corresponds to the cell
        whose bottom left corner is at $(x,y) = (0,0)$.  The character at the top right corresponds to
        the cell whose bottom left corner is $(x,y) = (w-1,h-1)$.
    </p>

    <p>
        From now on, we will refer to the cell that occupies the rectangle $[a,a+1] \times [b,b+1]$ in the
        $xy$-plane as the $(a,b)$-cell.
    </p>

    <h2>Program Specification</h2>

    <h3>Position at Rest</h3>
    <p>
        When the camera is not moving to another cell (as a response to keyboard input),
        it should be located at the middle point of a walkable cell.  In other words, the $xy$-position of the
        camera should be at $(a+0.5,b+0.5)$ where $(a,b)$ is a walkable cell.
    </p>

    <h3>Heading at Rest</h3>
    <p>
        When the camera is not turning, its heading should be equivalent to $0$, $\pi/2$,
        $\pi$, or $3\pi/2$ radians. In other words, when stationary, the camera should always be facing north, east, west, or south.
    </p>

    <h3>Changing Position</h3>

    <p>
        When the user presses the up arrow key, the camera should move to the cell in the direction of the current
        camera heading if it is walkable. If the cell in that direction is not walkable (i.e., the camera is facing a wall),
        the camera should not move.
    </p>

    <p>
        The canvas should show a smooth transition to the new location. To implement this, you can define an
        animation duration (a quarter of a second or so) during which the camera position linearly interpolates
        between the old position and the new position. During this transition period, all keystrokes and
        user interaction can be ignored.
    </p>

    <p>
        The program should exhibit similar behavior when the down arrow key is pressed.  However,
        the camera should move backward instead of forward.
    </p>

    <h3>Changing Heading</h3>

    <p>
        When the user presses the left arrow key, the camera should increase its heading by $\pi/2$ radians.
        The canvas should show a smooth transition, interpolating between the old heading
        and the new heading over some animation period. Once again, all input during this animation can be ignored.
    </p>

    <p>
        The system should exhibit similar behavior when the right arrow key is pressed.  However,
        the heading should decrease by $\pi/2$ radians instead of increasing by that amount.
    </p>

    <h3>Camera's Height</h3>

    <p>
        The $z$-position of the camera's position should be specified by the value in the
        "Eye height" spinner. A height of 0 would mean that the camera is touching the ground
        plane, and a height if 1 would mean that the camera is aligned with the top of the walls.
        Use the provided <code>getEyeHeight()</code> method to access this value. Call this function every frame.
    </p>

    <h3>Camera's Field of View</h3>

    <p>
        When constructing the projection matrix, its field of view (in degrees) should be specified
        by the value in the "Field of view" spinner. This is the field of view of the vertical ($y$)
        opening of the frustum. Use the provided <code>getFOV()</code> method to access this value,
        which is converted to radians automatically. Call this function every frame.
    </p>

    <h2>Implementation Details</h2>

    <h3>Textures</h3>

    <p>
        We have provided textures to use to indicate the floor and the wall in the <code>data/</code>
        folder:
    </p>
    <table class="table table-bordered">
        <tr>
            <td align="center">
                <img width="300" src="../ppa03_student/data/floor.jpg" >
            </td>
            <td align="center">
                <img width="300" src="../ppa03_student/data/wall.jpg" >
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td align="center">
                <code>ppa03_student/data/floor.jpg</code>
                <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/tilling-textures-pack-02">(Source)</a>
            </td>
            <td align="center">
                <code>ppa03_student/data/wall.jpg</code>
                <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/free-tilling-textures-pack-29">(Source)</a>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        We obtained these textures from <a href="http://opengameart.org/">OpenGameArt</a>.  They are created
        by <a href="https://opengameart.org/users/yughues">yughues</a> and are listed as belonging to the
        public domain.
    </p>

    <h3>Sky Color</h3>

    <p>
        The sky color we used is RGB = $(0.3, 0.7, 1.0)$.  You don't have to use the exact same color,
        but choose a color that clearly delineates the background.
    </p>

    <h3>Maze Data Structure</h3>

    <p>
        The template code has a global variable called <code>maze</code> that is updated every time
        the "Update Maze" button is clicked.  The variable contains an object which the following fields:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>sizeX</code> = the number of cells in the $x$-direction.</li>
        <li><code>sizeY</code> = the number of cells in the $y$-direction.</li>
        <li><code>startHeading</code> = the initial heading of the camera in radians.</li>
        <li><code>startPosition</code> = a two-element array containing the integer coordinates of the initial cell.</li>
        <li>
            <code>data</code> = a two-dimensional array containing integers which indicate
            whether the cells are walkable or unwalkable.
            <ul>
                <li>If <code>data[x][y] = 0</code>, then the $(x,y)$-cell is walkable.</li>
                <li>If <code>data[x][y] = 1</code>, then the $(x,y)$-cell is unwalkable.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Perspective Matrix</h3>

    <p>
        You will need to create a perspective matrix to display the 3D geometry. See
        <a href="../lecture06/exhibit07.html">Lecture 6 Exhibit 7</a> for an example. It may help to know
        that the canvas width will always be 800 pixels and the canvas height will always be 600 pixels.
        You can assume that nothing in the scene will be closer to the camera that 0.1 units and nothing
        will be further away than 100 units.
    </p>

    <h2>Additional Features</h2>

    <p>
        In order to receive full credit, you must implement at least one other feature beyond what is
        specified above. The amount of points you will receive depends on the effort spent on extra
        features. Implementing many features, or implementing an especially impressive feature, may earn extra credit.
        Some ideas for extra features are listed below.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Better shading:</b>  The reference solution just displays the wall and floor textures without
            any modification.  Implement shading with normal mapping as you did in A4.  You can find the normal maps
            of the textures in the "Source" links above.  You have the freedom of choosing the positions
            of the light sources, but make sure that all walls and every part of the floor are lit.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Sky box:</b>  A solid color is a bland choice for a sky.  Implement a fancier sky box using some textures
            that can be found <a href="https://opengameart.org/art-search?keys=skybox">here</a>, or create your own sky model
            using the techniques you used in PPA2. WebGL's support for cubemaps may be useful here.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Objects:</b>  Treasure boxes.  Gems and gold pieces.  Zombies.  You name it.
            Modify the string representation parser so that these objects can be placed in the scene by modifying
            the string representation. For an additional challenge, add animation effects to these objects.
        </li>

        <li><b>Smooth animation:</b> Instead of linearly interpolating camera positions and orientations, use a
            different interpolation scheme that smoothly transitions between the endpoints of the animations.
            Referencing the 4620 lectures on splines may be useful here.
        </li>

        <li>
            Come up with your own idea. If you want to try something but are unsure of how to implement it, please consult the course staff.
        </li>
    </ul>
