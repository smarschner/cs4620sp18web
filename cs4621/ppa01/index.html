    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>In this programming assignment, you will implement a simplified GPU version of the CS4620 raytracer (Ray 1).
        The goal here is not to reproduce all the features we have seen in the other assignment, but rather to give you
        some practice programming WebGL applications.</p>

    <p><b>WARNING: WE THINK THIS ASSIGNMENT IS LONG.  START EARLY.</b></p>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>

        Note that this video was recorded by Pramook Khungurn for the Spring 2017 version of this class. The assignment
        has changed in places, but everything in this video is up to date.
    </small>

    <h2>Logistics</h2>

<!--     <p>First, clone the <a href="https://github.com/smarschner/4620sp18web">CS 4620 web repository</a>.
    You will find the template code for this assignment in the <code>cs4621/ppa1_student</code> directory.</p> -->

    <p>
        First, download the <a href="ppa01_framework.zip">starter code</a>. We recommend creating a git repository for
        development, but <b>please don't share your code publicly.</b>
    </p>

    <p>Inside the directory, open <code>index.html</code>, and you should see something like this.</p>

    <center>
        <a href="template_web.png"><img src="template_web.png" alt="template web page for ppa1" width="300"></a>
    </center>

    <p>Please modify <code>index.html</code> so that it performs ray tracing and shows the output in the black canvas
    on the top of the web page.  You may also add other code to the directory.  However, do not use any 3D rendering
    frameworks such as <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a>.  Linear algebra libraries such as
    <a href="http://glmatrix.net/">glMatrix</a> are fine.  Our solution code, however, does not use any
    extra code besides what is already in the ZIP file.</p>

    <p>Once you're done writing your solution, ZIP the directory, and submit it to CMS.</p>

    <h2>Implementation Details</h2>

    <h3>Camera and Ray Generation</h3>

    <p>Instead of the more involved camera model in the Ray 1 assignment, the camera model in this assignment is a little
        simpler.  It is specified by 4 parameters:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Eye</b> = the camera's position in world space.</li>
        <li><b>Target</b> = the point in world space at which the the camera is pointing.</li>
        <li><b>Up</b> = the direction opposite gravity; specifies the orientation of the camera.</li>
        <li><b>Field of view (FOV)</b> = an indication of the extent of the scene observed by the camera.  It is an angle,
        measured in <em>degrees</em>.  You can find out more about FOV in this
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_view_in_video_games">Wikipedia article</a>. Since our canvas is a square,
        the horizontal FOV is equal to the vertical FOV.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>To generate rays from the camera, first form an orthonormal basis $[\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}, \mathbf{z}]$
        as follows:
        \begin{align*}
        \mathbf{z} &= \mathrm{normalize}(eye - target) \\
        \mathbf{x} &= \mathrm{normalize}(up \times \mathbf{z}) \\
        \mathbf{y} &= \mathrm{normalize}(\mathbf{z} \times \mathbf{x})
        \end{align*}
    </p>

    <p>The image plane is parameterized by $(x,y)$ coordinates where both $x$ and $y$ ranges from $[-1,1]$.
        So, consider drawing a full screen quad so that the bottom-left corner corresponds to $(-1,-1)$ and
        the top-right corner corresponds to $(1,1)$.
    </p>

    <p>
        All rays originate from the camera's eye position.  The ray associated with image plane coordinate $(x,y)$
        has direction:
        $$\mathbf{d} = \mathrm{normalize}(-\mathbf{z} + (s\ x)\ \mathbf{x} + (s\ y)\ \mathbf{y})$$
        where
        $$ s = \tan \bigg( \frac{\pi}{180} \frac{FOV}{2} \bigg).$$
        In other words, we convert $FOV/2$ to radian and compute its tangent.
        Note that the ray starts right off from the eye position, not from a plane that is in front of it.
        This is because our camera model does not have something equivalent to <code>projDistance</code>
        in the Ray 1 assignment.
    </p>

    <p>The camera can be controlled by the GUI elements in <code>index.html</code>.  Its JavaScript code
        contains the convenience methods for retrieving the camera parameters:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>getCameraEye()</code></li>
        <li><code>getCameraTarget()</code></li>
        <li><code>getCameraUp()</code></li>
        <li><code>getCameraFov()</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Call these functions every frame, and pass their return values to your shader.
    </p>

    <h3>Light Source</h3>

    <p>Every scene in this assignment has one point light source, and it is defined
    by two parameters: its <b>position</b> and <b>intensity</b>.  These parameters can be controlled
    by GUI elements, and the template code provides the following functions for retrieving their values:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>getLightPosition()</code></li>
        <li><code>getLightIntesity()</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Again, call these functions every frame, and pass their return values to your shader.
    </p>

    <h3>Background Color</h3>

    <p>If the eye ray does not hit any geometry, your shader should set the pixel to
    the background color that is specified by the GUI in <code>index.html</code>.
    Use the function <code>getBackgroundColor()</code> to retrieve its value.
    </p>

    <h3>Scenes</h3>

    <p>
        In the template code, we have included three scenes that you can render: the "triangle," the "cube," and
        the "full" scene.  You can switch between theme through the GUI.  In JavaScript, use the
        <code>getScene()</code> function to retrieve the current scene specified by the GUI.</p>

    <p>
        The value returned by the <code>getScene()</code> function is a JavaScript object with the following fields:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>numTriangles</code> is the number of triangles in the scene.</li>
        <li>
            <code>vertexPositions</code> is an array containing $3 \times n$
            floating point numbers, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the mesh.
            It contains the 3D positions of each vertex in a flat list.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>triangleColors</code> is an array containing $3 \times k$ floating point numbers, where $k$ is the number of
            colors used in the scene. It contains diffuse colors $(k_D)$ in RGB format in a flat list.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>triangleIndices</code> is an array containing $4 \times numTriangles$ integers. For each triangle, it specifies
            3 indices into <code>vertexPositions</code> (one for each of its vertices), and one index into
            <code>triangleColors</code>, in that order. Again, this is a flat list.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This is similar to indexed structures you've seen before, except colors are specified for each face rather than for each
        vertex. Note that none of the meshes have normal or texture coordinate data. If you would like to know how the scene objects
        are created, read <code>scenes.js</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        In your shader, you should create a uniform array that stores all of the indices for the triangles. For example:
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-glsl">uniform ivec4 triangleIndices[MAX_TRIANGLES];
</code></pre>
        The full scene is the largest scene, and it contains 132 triangles, so you can set <code>MAX_TRIANGLES</code>
        to $132$.
    </p>
    <p>
        To transfer the vertex positions and triangle colors, you'll need to use textures, as uniform arrays can only be accessed
        monotonically (i.e., with loop variables and constants). Within your fragment shader, you can use samplers to access these
        textures:
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-glsl">uniform sampler2D vertexPositions;
uniform sampler2D triangleColors;
</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that transferring lots of data to the GPU is a slow operation. These scenes are small enough that you shouldn't
        encounter performance problems if you update <code>triangleIndices</code>, <code>vertexPositions</code>, and
        <code>triangleColors</code> on every frame (and you will not be penalized if you do this), but we recommend only
        updating these variables when necessary (i.e., when the user changes which scene is displayed), since this is
        good practice.
    </p>

    <h3>Render Modes</h3>

    <p>Your ray tracer should support the following rendering modes</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Face color mode:</b> If the ray associated with a pixel hits a triangle, set that pixel
            to the triangle's color.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Normal mode:</b> If the ray associated with a pixel hits a triangle, compute the triangle's
            normal vector $\mathbf{n}$.  Then, set the pixel value to $(\mathbf{n} + (1,1,1)) / 2$
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Shadow mode:</b> If the ray associated with a pixel hits a triangle, trace the shadow ray
            from the hit point to the light source.  If the light is occluded, set the pixel to black.
            If not, set the pixel to white.  <i><b>DO NOT FORGET TO ADD EPSILON TO THE RAY STARTING POINT.</b></i>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Full mode:</b> This mode performs the full shading of a diffuse BRDF against a point light
            source.  If the ray associated with a pixel hits a triangle, set the pixel color to:
            $$ (visibility) \times (triangle\ color) \times \max(0, \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{l}) \times
            \frac{light\ intensity}{r^2}$$
            where
            <ul>
                <li>visibility is $0$ if the light is occluded and $1$ otherwise,</li>
                <li>$\mathbf{l}$ is the unit vector pointing in the direction from the hit point
                    to the light source's position.</li>
                <li>$r$ is the distance between the hit point and the light source.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The render mode can be changed by the GUI.  You can retrieve the current rendering mode
        in JavaScript by calling the <code>getRenderMode()</code> function.  It returns an integer
        where $1$ means the face color mode, $2$ means the normal mode, $3$ means the shadow mode,
        and $4$ means the full mode.  Pass this value to your shader every frame.
    </p>

    <h3>WebGL Limitations</h3>

    <p>The WebGL specification was written for hardware with limited capabilities, so there are
    some operations you would be able to do in normal programming languages but cannot do
    in GLSL.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            If you write a for loop, the number of iterations must be known at compile time.
            This means that you cannot do something like this:
<pre class="prettyprint">uniform int numTriangles;

for(int i=0; i&lt;numTriangles; i++) {
    :
    :
}
</pre>
            But you can do something like this:
<pre class="prettyprint">const int MAX_TRIANGLES = 132;
uniform int numTriangles;

for(int i=0; i&lt;MAX_TRIANGLES; i++) {
    if (i >= numTriangles)
        break;
    :
    :
}
</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            Array access in the fragment shader is limited.  You can only index an array with an expression
            made up of loop counters and constants.  In other words, if we were to store vertex positions in
            a uniform array, the following would be okay:
<pre class="prettyprint">uniform vec3 vertexPositions;

vec3 p = vertexPosition[0];

for(int i=0; i&lt;MAX_TRIANGLES; i++) {
    vec3 a = vertexPositions[3*i];
    vec3 b = vertexPositions[3*i+1];
    vec3 c = vertexPositions[3*i+2];
    :
    :
}
</pre>
            But, this is not:
<pre class="prettyprint">uniform vec3 vertexPositions;
uniform int vertexIndex;

vec3 p = vertexPositions[p];
</pre>
            This is why we are storing the vertex positions and triangle colors in textures; any
            piece of a texture can be accessed by any pixel. This way, you can loop over all triangles
            by looping over the <code>triangleIndices</code> array.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>WebGL Features</h3>

    <p>
        When writing a function, you can use the keywords to quantify function parameters so that
        you can pass values <i>back</i> from the function as well.  This is very useful when writing a function that
        has more than one return value. The relevant keywords are <code>out</code> and/or <code>inout</code>.
        Using them, you can do this:
<pre class="prettyprint">void computeSomething(float x, out float y, inout float z) {
    y = x + 1.0;
    z = 2.0*(x+z);
}

void main() {
    float a;
    float b = 2.0;
    computeSomething(5, a, b);
      :
      :
      :
}
</pre>
        After <code>computeSomething</code> is called, <code>a</code> becomes 6, and <code>b</code> becomes 14.
    </p>

    <h2>Programming Tips</h2>

    <p>
        This may all seem a little daunting. This project contains many pieces in a language (or, potentially, in
        languages) that you have never used before. Additionally, debugging is difficult; JavaScript has the
        advantage of <code>console.log(...)</code>, but there is no way to print out values in GLSL code.
    </p>

    <p>
        We strongly recommend taking the following advice:
        <blockquote>KEEP CALM AND INCREMENTALLY ADD FEATURES.</blockquote>
        Do not implement all features at once without testing them individually. You will end up with a black canvas, and you will have
        no idea what parts of your code aren't working. Break the assignment to easy-to-finish and easy-to-test pieces.
        Here is a possible road map.
    </p>

                <li>Get a WebGL context.  See <a href="../lecture01/exhibit00.html">Exhibit #0 of Lecture 1</a>.</li>
                <li>Set up your rendering loop. See <a href="../lecture01/exhibit05.html">Exhibit #5 of Lecture 1</a>.</li>
            </ul>

                    What are the texture coordinates of the 4 corners of the full screen quad in Exhibit #6?
                    Are they the most convenient for this assignment?
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Have your shader output the background color.

        </li>
        <li>
            Have your shader generate the rays. Before attempting to intersect them with the scene, output the ray direction as a color,
            using the same conversion from direction to color as with the normal render mode.
            You should see the canvas change as you change the FOV, camera location, or camera target.
        </li>
        <li>
            Work on the face color mode, i.e., ray intersection.
            <ul>

                <li>Learn how to create and use textures from <a href="../lecture03/exhibit00.html">Exhibit #0 of Lecture 3</a>.</li>
                <li>Write your code to intersect just the first triangle in the mesh first.</li>
                <li>Get your code to work with the "triangle" scene, which has only one triangle.</li>
                <li>Then, write a for loop that goes through all the triangles to find the first intersection.</li>
                <li>Then, try to get the "cube" scene to work.</li>
                <li>Once you're confident, run your code on the "full" scene.</li>
                <li>From our experience, this step is the hardest because ray tracing is complicated in itself.
                    It's also very easy to trip up over little details.  Be patient here.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Work on the normal mode.
        </li>
        <li>
            Work on the shadow mode, i.e., shadow ray casting.
        </li>
        <li>
            Work on the full mode.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>We would also like to remind you that the exhibits are for you to use.  However, do not just
    copy and paste them in your code.  Read and understand them so that so you can modify them to do
    your bidding.  Also, make use of the code you wrote for the Ray 1 assignment.  If you have to get a
    part of Ray 1 fixed first, come to us for help.</p>

        Remember, though, to make up new test cases on your own because we will do so to test your program too.
