    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>
        Now that you have some experience using WebGL and JavaScript to create interactive graphics applications, you will spend the rest of the semester working on an application of your own design. What your program does is left up to you, but it must satisfy the following requirements:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Your application must render 2D or 3D images using WebGL.</li>
        <li>You may not use graphics libraries such as <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a> or <a href="https://d3js.org/">d3.js</a>. Convenience libraries such as <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> and <a href="http://glmatrix.net/">glMatrix</a> are acceptable.</li>
        <li>Your application must incorporate at least 2 of the following areas of computer graphics: <b>imaging, interaction, modeling, rendering, and animation</b>.</li>
        <li>Your application must be moderately complex. This means it should have more features than the other programming assignments in this course.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example projects</h2>

    <p>
        Listed below are some examples of acceptable final projects. This is by no means a complete list, and you should feel free to come up with your own project, but these examples demonstrate the complexity we are expecting. If you would like some resources describing how to approach one of the examples below, please talk to course staff.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            A modeling system that allows simple editing of triangle meshes and spline or subdivision surfaces (modeling) with care given to a user interface that allows all manipulations to be done intuitively (interaction).
        </li>
        <li>
            A Minecraft-like world that allows the user to roam a procedurally-generated world (modeling) and is able to efficiently render large scenes (rendering).
        </li>
        <li>
            A game that allows the user to roam a manually specified world and has fancy shading effects (rendering) and has an interactive level editor (interaction). You may build on PPA3 for this project, but if you do, we expect more features to be added.
        </li>
        <li>
            A procedural plant modeling system based on L-systems (modeling) with interactive control over parameters and constraints (interaction) or some fancy realistic rendering techniques (rendering).
        </li>
        <li>
            An artistic rendering system that simulates some traditional medium (pen-and-ink, watercolor, charcoal, ...) under interactive control (rendering, interaction).
        </li>
        <li>
            Some kind of physics simulation, such as a particle system, a system of rigid bodies, a deformable object such as cloth, or fluid simulation (animation), with either associated interactive authoring tools (to allow setting up initial conditions, interacting with the running simulation -- interaction) or some shading techniques for realistic results (rendering).
        </li>
        <li>
            A volume renderer for medical data that supports direct volume rendering (imaging) and also either extraction of isosurfaces from the volumes (modeling) or an interactive system for adjusting the rendering parameters, extracting slices, etc. (interaction).
        </li>
        <li>
            A blobby modeling system based on implicit surfaces (modeling) that are either triangulated for display or ray traced directly (rendering), with simple tools to position the basis functions.
        </li>
        <li>
            A simple image editing program that can apply filters or modifications to existing images (imaging) or allows the user to draw on top of them (interaction).
        </li>
        <li>
            A tool for creating 2D or 3D animations from imported assets (3D meshes, images, etc.) that allows the user to set transformation keyframes and interpolates between them (interaction, animation).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Project Proposals and Forming Groups</h2>

    <p>
        Once you have an idea for your project, you will submit a 1-2 page project proposal that describes your idea and explains how it relates to 2 of the areas listed above. You may include figures in the proposal as well. The course staff will read your proposals and provide feedback to make sure that the project has the right scope. They will also point you towards resources that may help you as you design your application. As a result, your proposal does not have to be highly detailed, but it should explain the major features of your program and how you plan to implement them.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you would like to choose your team members, you are welcome to do so. In this case, your group will submit a single project proposal. Otherwise, you may submit a project proposal individually, and the course staff will then add you to a team based on the similarity of the submitted project proposals.
    </p>

    <h2>Milestone Presentations</h2>

    <p>
        After you have had some time to develop your project, your team will give a short presentation that explains your progress, demonstrates your current program, and explains what is left to do.
    </p>

    <p>
        More details coming soon...
    </p>

    <h2>Project Report</h2>

    <p>
        Once you have completed your project, you will submit the project itself to CMS. Additionally, you will write a report that explains what your program does, and how each piece of your program fits together.
    </p>

    <p>
        More details coming soon...
