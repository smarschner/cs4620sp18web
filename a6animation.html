<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>
    In this assignment, we will explore a common topic in animation: key frame animation. You will solve some written problems to get a better understanding of the underlying theory of animations and then write code to animate scenes using key frames. Key frame animation is a technique wherein we define the layout of a scene at certain times (key frames), and we create frames between them by cleverly interpolating between our defined key frames. This rapid rendering of scenes gives us the illusion of animation. The award winning animation short film <a href="http://bit.ly/1EDvU6R">Hunger</a>  (1974) was one of the first applications of computerized key frame animation.

<h4>Written Problem 1 - Interpolating in 2D</h4>

Below are pictures of a square object (rotated by 45 degrees and with its edges marked so you can tell them apart) under three pairs of linear transformations. Each small cell has size 0.5 (e.g. both vertical and horizontal coordinates range from -1.5 to 1.5). For each pair (keeping in mind that transformations are with respect to initial figure):

<ol>
    <li>Write the 2x2 transformation matrices for each pose; call them \(M_0\) and \(M_1\).</li>
    <li>Write the matrix \(M_{0.5}^{lin}\) by linearly interpolating elementwise halfway between \(M_0\) and \(M_1\).</li>
    <li>Write each of these two poses in the form \(M_i = R_iS_i\), where \(R_i\) is a rotation and \(S_i\) is a symmetric matrix with positive entries on the diagonal.</li>
    <li>Use this decomposition to interpolate a matrix \(M_{0.5}^{pol}\) that is halfway between \(M_0\) and \(M_1\).</li>
    <li>Draw the two intermediate states of the object (you can export a PDF and draw on it if you want).</li>
</ol>

<h4>Written Problem 2 - Interpolating 3D Rotations</h4>

In your computations you might like to use the <tt>egl.math.Quat</tt> class to convert between quaternions and rotation matrices.

<ol>
    <li>Write down the quaternion \(q_1\)that corresponds to the identity rotation and the quaternion \(q_2\) that corresponds to a rotation of 180 degrees around the y axis.</li>
    <li>Using the formula for spherical linear interpolation, generate the quaternion \(q_3\) that is one-sixth of the way from \(q_1\) to \(q_2\). What are the axis and angle of the rotation \(q_3\) represents?</li>
    <li>Convert \(q_3\) to a 3x3 rotation matrix \(M(q_3)\). Verify that starting with the identity and applying this matrix 6 times results in the rotation corresponding to \(q_2\).</li>

    <h3>Problem 1: Keyframe Animation</h3>

    <h4>Getting Started</h4>
    For the programming assignment, we will implement the primary features of a keyframe animation framework. A new commit has been pushed to the class Github page in the master branch. We recommend switching to your master branch, pulling this commit, and creating a new branch (e.g. A6 solution) and committing your work there. This new commit contains all the framework changes and additions necessary for this project. For this project, we use lwjgl, so you may need to update some settings of your build to have this external library work properly. We have included the correct jar files, but you may need to configure your native library location. To do this in Eclipse, go to <tt> Project -&gt; Properties -&gt; Java Build Path -&gt; Select Libraries -&gt; Select the lwjgl Drop Down Menu -&gt; Modify Native Library Location. </tt> Modify this setting so that it matches your OS.
    We have added a framework in the package anim that stores keyframes and provides an interface for editing them; you will build on that framework and implement a few main features that enable correct interpolation of animations between keyframes.

    <h4>The Interface</h4>

    <ul>
        <li> Select a frame: Left click on the frame in the timeline.</li>
        <li> Adding a frame: Double click your left mouse button.</li>
        <li> Editing a keyframe: Left click on it, edit the transformations at that state, and left click again to update the keyframe's transformation.</li>
        <li> Removing a keyframe: Double click your right mouse button.</li>
        <li> Playing and pausing the animation: The space bar is used to play or pause the animation.</li>
        <li> Changing the method of rotation: The <tt>/</tt> is used to alternate between three methods of rotation.</li>
    </ul>  

    <h4>Keyframes</h4>

    For this problem, we have extended the scene graph system to store information about the transformations of each object at multiple keyframes. This information is managed by the <tt>AnimationEngine</tt>, which keeps an <tt>AnimationTimeline</tt> for each animated object in the scene.  The animation data is stored in the <tt>AnimationTimeline</tt>s, each of which contains:
    <ul>
        <li> A <tt>TreeSet</tt> of <tt>AnimKeyFrame</tt>. Each key frame contains a frame index number and a 4 x 4 matrix transformation.</li>
        <li> A <tt>SceneObject</tt> that this timeline operates on.</li>
    </ul>
    Every time the <tt>update</tt> loop is called in the Game loop, <tt>AnimationEngine.updateTransformations</tt> is called.  For each timeline, this method calls <tt>AnimationTimeline.updateTransformation</tt>, which computes the transformation for a single object at the current time. Finally <tt>AnimationEngine.updateTransformations</tt> sends a transformation-update event to the corresponding <tt>SceneObject</tt>.


    <h4>What You Will Do</h4>

    All the parts you need to implement are in AnimationTimeline.java.
    <ul>
        <li> Implement <tt>AnimationTimeline.addKeyFrame</tt>.</li>
        <li> Implement <tt>AnimationTimeline.removeKeyFrame</tt>.</li>
        <li> Implement <tt>AnimationTimeline.updateTransformation</tt> &mdash; 
            A method that computes the transformation for the current time.</li>
        <li> Create Interesting Animation &mdash; 
            After completing this short coding assignment, use one of the included scenes to create an interesting animation. This should showcase all of your working transformations (rotation, scaling, and translation). Screen capture your animation and include this video in your submission.</li>
        <li> Create Buggy Animation &mdash;
            After you have implemented the three methods of rotation use one of the included scenes to demonstrate a "bug" with using Euler angles to interpolate rotations, and then show how using a spherical linear interpolation between quaternions resolves the issue. Screen capture your animation and include this video in your submission.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Interpolation Overview</h4>

    <h5>The na&iuml;ve linear approach</h5>

    When computing the interpolation of two transformations, the naive approach is to linearly interpolate each of the 12 free values of the 4 x 4 matrix. You may want to try this out and see why this doesn’t work so well. See what happens when you rotate an object 180 degrees!

    <h5>A better approch</h5>

    Linearly interpolating rotations by value does not work very well. While scales and translations can be linearly interpolated to give good results, the same doesn’t apply to rotations. So what can we do? 

    <p>Part of the problem with the linear approach is that the interpolated transformation might not be a rotation even if the two keyframe transformations are pure rotations.  One approach is to generalize we would do in 2D: convert the rotation matrix to an angle, and interpolate the angle.  The easiest way to generalize this is using Euler angles: we write the transformation as a product of three rotations that are around coordinate axes, like this:
    \[R(\theta_x, \theta_y, \theta_z) = R_x(\theta_x) R_y(\theta_y) R_z(\theta_z).\]
    (This is the same way we represented rotations in the Manipulators assignment, though we didn't call them Euler angles at the time.)  If we have two rotations \(R_1\) and \(R_2\), we first convert them to \((\theta_x, \theta_y, \theta_z)_1\) and \((\theta_x, \theta_y, \theta_z)_2\).  Then we linearly interpolate these two 3-vectors to get an interpolated set of angles, and then compute the interpolated rotation from the interpolated Euler angles.

    <p>The general idea for making this work while still supporting general matrix transformations is:
    <p><ul>
        <li> Decompose the surrounding 4x4 matrix transformations around the current key frame into rotations, translations, and scales.  (Details below.)</li>
        <li> Linearly interpolate the translations and scales, and interpolate the rotations by converting to Euler angles, interpolating, and then converting the resulting angles back to a rotation matrix.</li>
        <li> Recompose the constituents to give a transformation for the current frame.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can use the provided <tt>eulerDecomp</tt> method to convert a matrix to Euler angles.  Try this out once you get it working&mdash;it should work pretty nicely for coordinate axis rotations, but you should be able to find some cases that behave really strangely.  (See the lecture notes for some hints.)

    <h5>The best approach</h5>

    It turns out there is a good way to interpolate between two pure rotations, that behaves well for any two rotations: first express the rotations as quaternions, then interpolate between the quaternions.  As discussed in lecture, the best way to interpolate (which results in a constant speed across the whole interval between two keyframes) is to use spherical linear interpolation, abbreviated &ldquo;slerp,&rdquo; to interpolate between the quaternions.  This replaces the middle step with:

    <p><ul>
        <li> Linearly interpolate the translations and scales, and interpolate the rotations by converting them to quaternions, interpolating between the quaternions, and then converting the resulting quaternion back to a rotation matrix.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>See below for a discussion of the conversions and interpolation methods.

    <h5>Decomposing transformations</h5>

    Both of the better methods require taking a general matrix and expressing it as a combination of rotation, translation, and scale.  A homogenous transformation M is a 4x4 matrix that can be decomposed firstly as follows

    \[
    \begin{pmatrix}
    RS & T \\
    0 & 1 \\
    \end{pmatrix}
    \]

    Here, \(T\) represents the translation, \(R\) the rotation and \(S\) the scale. So just how do we decompose the upper left 3x3 portion of the matrix into its constituents? Polar decomposition. You will find an algorighm to compute the polar decomposition implemented in <tt>egl.math.Matrix3.polar_decomp</tt> for you.

    There is more about Euler angles, quaternions, spherical linear interpolation, and the polar decomposition in the Animation lecture slides and notes, and in Chapter 17 of the textbook.

    <h4>Slerp</h4>

    Spherical linear interpolation occurs between quaternions, so we need to convert our representation of \(R\) as a 3 x 3 matrix into a quaternion for each keyframe, and then convert the interpolated quaternion back to a matrix.

    <h5>Converting between Rotation Matrices and Quaternions</h5>

    We do not ask you to implement the inter-conversion between rotation matrices and Quaternions. You can use the class <tt>egl.math.Quat</tt> to convert from a rotation matrix (using the appropriate <tt>Quat</tt> constructor) and to a rotation matrix (using the <tt>toRotationMatrix</tt> method). Feel free to look at the code to understand how it works if you’re interested. All you need to know about Quaternions is that they are 4-vectors, and that unit-length quaternions, called unit quaternions, can represent 3D rotations and also interpolate them well.


    <h5>Linear Interpolation</h5>

    Typically, we visualize quaternions as vectors that represent rotation. Yes, they have 4 numbers, but as most things with higher dimensionality, imagine them to be in a lower dimensional space, say 2D, and say “four” to yourself. Given two quaternions \(q_1\) and \(q_2\), and a \(t\) to interpolate such that \(0 < t < 1\), a linear interpolation, or lerp, q is given by:

    \[
    q = (1 - t)q_1 + tq_2
    \]
    This will work, if we normalize the interpolated quaternion so that it’s a unit quaternion again, but unfortunately the rotation does not happen at constant speed—it will go faster towards \(t=0.5\) and slower towards the ends.

    <h5>Spherical Linear Interpolation</h5>
    Intuitively, spherical linear interpolation, or slerp, gets around this problem by interpolating these quaternions (read: vectors) along the sphere they are both a part of. We’ll avoid the details of the derivation of the slerp formula, which are in the lecture slides. Let’s just review how slerp is calculated. Given quaternions \(q_1\) and \(q_2\) at the surrounding key frames and an interpolation ratio \(t\) such that \(0 < t < 1\), we first calculate the angle between \(q_1\) and \(q_2\), called \(\Omega\), as follows:

    \[
    cos\Omega = q_1 \cdot q_2
    \]

    Then the interpolated quaternion q is given by

    \[
    q = \frac{sin(\Omega - t\Omega)}{sin\Omega}q_1 + \frac{sin(t\Omega)}{sin\Omega}q_2
    \]

    We have implementated this in the <tt>egl.math.Quat.slerp</tt> function for you as well.



    <h4>Interpolation Modes</h4>
    Our framework supports three different interpolation modes: Euler angles, Linear interpolation of quaternions, and spherical linear interpolation of quaternions. You will need to support all three of these in the function <tt>AnimationTimeline.updateTransformation</tt>. The mode currently selected is indicated by the argument <tt>rotation</tt>. We have described the latter two modes in detail above. In order to implement Euler angles, you will need to decompose the rotation matrices into Euler angles (using a function we have provided), linearly interpolate, and then recompose into a rotation matrix (you will find useful Matrix3 functions for this).
