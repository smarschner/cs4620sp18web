    <h2>Logistics</h2>

    <p>
        First, clone the <a href="https://github.com/smarschner/4620sp17web">CS 4620 web repository</a>.
        You will find the template code for this assignment in the <code>cs4621/ppa03_student</code> directory.
    </p>

    <p>
        Inside the directory, open <code>index.html</code>, and you should see a web page with a black canvas 
        and some controls.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please modify <code>index.html</code> so that it implements the maze crawler whose behavior is similar
        to the one in the video. You may also add other code to the directory. However, do not use any 3D rendering
        framework such as <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a>. Linear algebra libraries such as
        <a href="http://glmatrix.net/">glMatrix</a> and convenience libraries such as 
        <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> and <a href="http://www.createjs.com/preloadjs">PreloadJS</a>
        are fine.  In fact, we have included in the distributed starter code.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Implementing a complete maze crawler is only one part of this assigment (70% of the grade).
        To get full credit (the rest 30%), you have to implement at least one additional feature that are
        listed later in this writeup.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Once you're done writing your solution, ZIP the <code>cs4621/ppa03_student</code>, and submit
        the ZIP file to CMS.
    </p>

    <h2>Maze Specification</h2>

    <p>
        A maze is a <i>rectangular</i> grid divided into equally sized cells.  A cell is a square in
        the $xy$-plane whose size is $1 \times 1$ (in some unit).  There are two types of cells: <b>walkable</b>
        and <b>unwalkable</b>.  If a walkable cell is adjacent to an unwalkable cell, there must be a vertical
        wall on their common cell edge.  A vertical wall is also a flat square whose size is also $1 \times 1$.
        One of its dimension is the $z$-axis, which is our vertical axis.</p>
    <p>
        A maze is specified by its text representation that is entered into the "Maze" text area in
        <code>index.html</code>.  The text representation may contain the following types of characters:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>New line character; i.e. <code>\n</code>.</li>
        <li>The pound character <code>#</code>, representing an unwalkable cell.</li>
        <li>The dot character <code>.</code>, representing a walkable cell.</li>
        <li>
            The directional character, <code>N</code>, <code>E</code>, <code>W</code>, or <code>S</code>,
            representing a walkable cell that the camera is initially at.  The four characters represent
            the initial "heading" of the camera.  Heading is the 2D direction in the $xy$-plane of the
            view direction.  It is specified as the angle the view vector makes with the
            positive $x$-axis.
            <ul>
                <li><code>N</code> is the "north" direction $(0,1,0)$ and the heading is $\pi/2$.</li>
                <li><code>E</code> is the "east" direction $(1,0,0)$ and the heading is $0$.</li>
                <li><code>W</code> is the "west" direction $(-1,0,0)$ and the heading is $\pi$.</li>
                <li><code>S</code> is the "south" direction $(0,-1,0)$ and the heading is $3\pi/2$.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        A valid string representation must satisfy the following conditions:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            The characters must form a rectangle.  In other words, every line of the string must have
            the same number of characters.
        </li>
        <li>
            Every character of the border of the rectangle must be <code>#</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
            There is exactly one directional character in the mesh.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>The template code has a function that check the above conditions.  If one of them is not satisifed,
    the code will throw an exception, and the program will stop.  As a result, you don't have to worry
    about them when you program, but you should keep them in mind when editing the string representation
    to test your program.</p>

    <p>
        The string representation represents what the maze looks like if you look at it from above (i.e.
        from where the $z$-coordinate is high).  If the string representation has $h$ rows and
        $w$ (non-whitespace) characters in each row, then there are $w \times h$ cells in the maze,
        and the maze should occupy the rectangle $[0,w] \times [0,h]$ in the $xy$-plane.
        The character at the bottom left corner of the string representation corresponds to the cell
        whose bottom left corner is at $(x,y) = (0,0)$.  The character at the top right correponds to
        the cell whose bottom left corner is $(x,y) = (w-1,h-1)$.
    </p>

    <p>
        From now on, let us refer to the cell that occupies the rectangle $[a,a+1] \times [b,b+1]$ in the
        $xy$-plane as the $(a,b)$-cell.
    </p>

    <h2>Behavioral Specification</h2>

    <h3>Position at Rest</h3>
    <p>
        When the camera is not moving to another cell (as a response to a keyboard input),
        it should be located at the middle point of a walkable cell.  In other words, the $xy$-position of the
        camera should be at $(a+0.5,b+0.5)$ where $(a,b)$ is a walkable cell.
    </p>

    <h3>Heading at Rest</h3>
    <p>
        When the camera is not turning, her heading should be equivalent to $0$, $\pi/2$,
        $\pi$, or $3\pi/2$.  In other words, no stopping at any other directions besides NEWS.
    </p>

    <h3>Changing Position</h3>

    <p>
        When the user presses the up arrow, the camera should move to the tell in front
        of the current cell according to the current heading if the cell in front is walkable.  The canvas
        should show a smooth transition to the new location, and this should not take too much time.
        If the cell in front is not walkable (i.e. the camera is in front of a wall), the camera should stay at
        the same place.
    </p>

    <p>
        The system should exhibit similar behavior when the down arrow is pressed.  However,
        the camera should move backward instead of forward.
    </p>

    <h3>Changing Heading</h3>

    <p>
        When the user presses the left arrow, the camera should increases its heading by $\pi/2$.
        The canvas should show a smooth transition to the new heading, and this should not take too much time.
    </p>

    <p>
        The system should exhibit similar behavior when the right arrow is pressed.  However,
        the heading should decreases by $\pi/2$ instead of increasing by that amount.
    </p>

    <h3>Camera's Height</h3>

    <p>
        The $z$-position of the camera's position should be specified by the value in the
        "Eye height" spinner.
    </p>

    <h3>Camera's Field of View</h3>

    <p>
        When constructing the projection matrix, its field of view (in degrees) should be specified
        by the value in the "Field of view" spinner.
    </p>

    <h2>Implementation Details</h2>

    <h3>Textures</h3>

    <p>
        We have provided textures to use to indicate the floor and the wall in the <code>ppa03_student/data</code>
        folder:
    </p>
    <table class="table table-bordered">
        <tr>
            <td align="center">
                <img width="300" src="../ppa03_student/data/floor.jpg" >
            </td>
            <td align="center">
                <img width="300" src="../ppa03_student/data/wall.jpg" >
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td align="center">
                <code>ppa03_student/data/floor.jpg</code>
                <a href="http://opengameart.org/content/tilling-textures-pack-02">(Source)</a>
            </td>
            <td align="center">
                <code>ppa03_student/data/wall.jpg</code>
                <a href="http://opengameart.org/content/free-tilling-textures-pack-29">(Source)</a>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        We got these textures from <a href="http://opengameart.org/">OpenGameArt</a>.  They are created
        by <a href="http://opengameart.org/users/yughues">yughues</a> and are listed as belonging to the
        public domain.
    </p>

    <h3>Sky Color</h3>

    <p>
        The sky color we used is RGB = $(0.3, 0.7, 1.0)$.  You don't have to use the exact same color,
        but choose it so that it's clear which part is the background.
    </p>

    <h3>Maze Data Structure</h3>

    <p>
        The template code has a global variable called <code>maze</code> that is updated every time
        the "Update Maze" button is clicked.  The variable contains an object which the following fields:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>sizeX</code> = the number of cells in the $x$-direction.</li>
        <li><code>sizeY</code> = the number of cells in the $y$-direction.</li>
        <li><code>startHeading</code> = the initial heading of the camera in radian.</li>
        <li><code>startPosition</code> = a two-element array containing the initial cell.</li>
        <li>
            <code>data</code> = a two-dimensional array containing integers which indicate
            whether the cells are walkable or unwalkable.
            <ul>
                <li>If <code>data[x][y] = 0</code>, then the $(x,y)$-cell is walkable.</li>
                <li>If <code>data[x][y] = 1</code>, then the $(x,y)$-cell is unwalkable.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Getting Camera Parameters</h3>

    <p>
        You can get the field of view in radian by calling the <code>getFov()</code> function.
        <i>Call this function every frame.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
        You can get the height of the eye by calling the <code>getEyeHeight()</code> function.
        <i>Call this function every frame.</i>
    </p>

    <h3>Perspective Matrix</h3>

    <p>
        Using glMatrix, you may construct the projection matrix with the following command:
<pre class="prettyprint">
var projMat = mat4.create();
mat4.perspective(projMat, getFov(), 800.0 / 600.0, 0.1, 100.0);
</pre>
    </p>

    <h2>Additional Features</h2>

    <p>In order to get full credit, you have to implement at least one of the following additional feature.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Better shading of floor and walls.</b>  The reference solution just display the texture without
        any modification.  Implement shading with normal mapping as you did in A4.  You can find the normal maps
        of the textures in the "Source" links we provided above.  You have the freedom of choosing the positions
        of the light sources, but make sure that all walls and every part of the floor is lit.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Sky box.</b>  The sky looks really bland right now.  Implement a fancier sky box using some textures
        that can be found <a href="http://opengameart.org/art-search?keys=skybox">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Insert other objects in the maze.</b>  Treasure boxes.  Dropped monies.  Zombies.  You name it.
        Modify the string representation parser so that these objects can be placed in the scene by modifying
        the string representation.
